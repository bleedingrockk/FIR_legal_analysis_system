Honorable Supreme Court, ultimately
came to the conclusion that section 167
(2), cr. p. c. would operate even for
offences under the NDPS act and then
section 27 of the NDPS act has no
application. In other words, section 27
of the NDPS act does not override
section 167 (2) of the code. Hence the
legal position set out by Balakrishnan,
J. in Appachan v. Excise Circle
Inspector, (1990) 2 ALT 610 (DB) is
correct

Honorable Supreme Court Has held -
Officers of DRI/Customs invested with
powers of investigation of offences
under S. 53 of the NDPS Act are not
Police Officers within the meaning of S.
25 of the Indian Evidence Act, as they
do not have power to lodge a report
under S. 173 of the Cr. P.C .--
Confessional statement made to such
officers is not hit by S. 25 of the Indian

A. Searches, seizures and arrests --
Narcotics offences -- Cr. P.C., Ss. 100 &
165 are applicable to offences under the
NDPS Act, since the latter Act is not a
complete code.
B. Search or arrest -- Narcotics offences-
-Police officer making a chance
recovery of narcotics, in the normal
course of investigation under the Cr.
P.C .-- NDPS Act, S. 50 not attracted --
Police officer, if he is empowered under
the NDPS Act, should inform an
empowered officer, who should
thereafter proceed in accordance with
the provisions of the NDPS Act.
C. Search or arrest -- Narcotics offences-
-Non-compliance with provisions of Cr.
P.C., Ss. 100 & 165 by an empowered or
authorised officer, would amount to an
"irregularity" but not vitiate the trial.
D.
Search -- Narcotics
officer --
Empowered or authorised officer,
acting
on prior
information --
Requirements of NDPS Act, S. 50 are
mandatory -- Noncompliance would
affect prosecution case and vitiate the
trial.
E. Arrest
or
seizure -- Narcotics
offences -- Seizure or arrest made under
NDPS Act, Ss. 41 to 44 -- Provisions of
Ss. 52 & 57 of NDPS Act not
mandatory, noncompliance does not
invalidate trial or conviction, but will
have bearing on appreciation of
evidence.

Honorable Supreme Court Has held :It
is mandatory for the searching officer
to inform the searched person about
his right to be searched in the presence
of a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer --
No presumption can be made in this
regard -- This point can also be raised in
Appeal for the first time -- - In the
absence of clear evidence that the
Officer conducting the search had
informed the person to be searched
that he was entitled to demand the
presence of a Gazetted Officer or a
Magistrate at the time of search, there
is no room for the Court to draw a
presumption U/S. 114 of the Evidence
Act that the Officer must have
informed the person to be
searched about the protection the

In the present case the question before
Honorable Supreme Court was that
whether the trial Court could hold the
mini trial to decide on the nature of the
statement and compliance of the
provisions under Section 42 of the
Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1985 in a case of grant
of bail on personal bond - It was held
that the non-compliance with the
provisions of the Act could be
examined at the trial stage but the
Court could have considered the fact
that accused had made a confessional
statement under Section 67 of the Act,
even if it was retracted later - Thus the
Court could not hold the mini trial
The bail was sought on the ground that
the accused
had
retracted the
confessional statement and it had no
evidentiary value - It was held that the
fact, whether the statement was
voluntary or not, could be decided only
after recording the evidence in the trial
thus the session judge had erred in
granting the bail without recording
sound reasons in terms of Section
37(1)(b) of the Act.

In the present case the question before
Honorable Supreme Court was that
whether re-summoning of witnesses by
Trial Court justified - Court cannot
exercise power of re-summoning any
witness if once that power was
exercised nor can the power be whittled
down merely on the ground that
prosecution discovered latches only
when the defence highlighted them
during final arguments - Held, the
power of the Court was plenary to
summon or even recall any witness at
any stage of the case if the Court
considers it necessary for a just
decision - Permission of Trial Court for
re-summoning
certain
witnesses
cannot therefore be spurned down nor
frowned at.

Honorable Supreme Court Has held
that it is an imperative requirement that
an empowered officer intending to
search a person for possession of
articles covered by NDPS Act should
inform him that he has a right to be
searched, if he so chooses, in the
presence of a Gazetted Officer or a
Magistrate. The requirement is for
safeguard and protection and it must be
followed scrupulously. The accused has
a right to be informed, though not in
writing. Failure to do so would render
search illegal and would vitiate the
conviction if not the trial-ratio of

The issue which came up for
consideration
before
Honorable
Supreme Court in this case was whether
the order passed by the High Court of
Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow
Bench, granting bail to respondent No. 1
Ram Samujh Yadav required to be set
aside on the ground that the High Court
ignored the provisions of Section 37
NDPS Act as well as the law laid down
by this Court. The Supreme Court after
examining the matter at length held that
The jurisdiction of the Court to grant
bail is circumscribed by the provision of
Section 37 of the NDPS Act. It can be
granted in case where there are
reasonable grounds for believing that
accused is not guilty of such offence and
that he is not likely to commit any
offence while on bail. It is the mandate
of the legislature which is required to be
followed. The Court set-aside the order
of the High Court granting bail to the
respondent and directed him to

160/2000
Honorable Supreme Court answered
the question as to whether prisoners
convicted under NDPS Act can be
considered for grant of parole under
Rules, 1958. Division Bench of this
Court in State Of Rajasthan Vs. Mana
Singh & Ors. (supra), took note of
decision of Apex court in Dadu v. State
of Maharashtra (AIR 2000 SC 3202)
and so also of S.32A of NDPS Act and
parole Rules, wherein it has observed
that the parole does not amount
suspension, remission or commutation
of sentence; as such a convict cannot be
deprived of benefit of parole under the
garb of S.32A of NDPS Act. The
Division Bench finally observed that in
view of Rule 1(c) of Rules, 1958,
persons convicted under NDPS Act can
be considered only under Rules framed
by Central Government; and further
observed that the Union of India may
frame Rules providing guidelines for
releasing the convicts of NDPS Act on
parole or transfer to the open air camps
keeping in view the objects behind
enactment of NDPS Act; and till such
Rules
are framed,
as
interim
arrangements, this Court provided
guidelines for concerned authority &

The Constitutional validity of Section
32-A of the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, was
challenged. The section is alleged to be
arbitrary, discriminatory and violative
of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution
of India which creates unreasonable
distinction between the prisoners
convicted under the Act and the
prisoners convicted for the offences
punishable
under
various
other
statutes.
It was held that awarding sentence,

judicial function to be discharged by
the Courts of law established in the
country. It is always a matter of judicial
discretion, however, subject to any
mandatory
minimum
sentence
prescribed by the Law. The award of
sentence by a criminal court wherever
made subject to the right of appeal
cannot be interfered or intermeddled
with in a way which amounts to not
only interference but actually taking
away the power of judicial review.
Awarding
the
sentence
and
consideration of its legality or adequacy
in appeal is essentially a judicial
function embracing within its ambit the
power to suspend the sentence under
peculiar circumstances of each case,
pending the disposal of the appeal. Not
providing atleast one right of appeal,
would negate the due process of law in
the matter of dispensation of criminal
justice. There is no doubt that the right
of appeal is the creature of a statute
and hence conferred, a substantive
right. Providing a right of appeal but
totally disarming the Court from
granting interim relief in the form of
suspension of sentence would be
unjust, unfair and violative of Article 21
of the Constitution particularly when
no mechanism is provided for early
disposal of the appeal. The pendency of
criminal litigation and the experience
in dealing with pending matters
indicate no possibility of early hearing
of the appeal and its disposal on merits
atleast in many High Courts.

Question came for consideration in this
case before the Court was whether the
restrictions imposed under Section 37
of the NDPS Act would be applicable in
a case where offence is punishable
under Section 20(b)(i) for possessing
Ganja? The Supreme Court held that
scheme of section 37 reveals that the
exercise of the power to grant bail by
the Special Judge is not only subject to
the limitations contained under Section
439 of the Cr.P.C., but is also subject to
the limitation placed by Section 37
which commences with nonobstante
clause. The operative part of the said
section is in negative in prescribing the
enlargement of bail of any person
accused of commission of an offence
under the Act unless two conditions are
satisfied. The first condition is that
prosecution must
be
given an
opportunity to oppose the application
and the second is that the Court must
be satisfied that there are reasonable
grounds for believing that he is not
guilty of such offence. If either of these
two conditions is not satisfied, the ban
for granting bail operates. As per the
mandate of Section 37, no person
accused of an offence punishable for a
term of imprisonment of 5 years or
more under the Act can be released on
bail unless the conditions mentioned in
subclauses (i) and (ii) of Clause (b) are
satisfied.

The Supreme Court held that unless
there are reasonable grounds for
believing that the accused is not guilty
of such offence and that he is not likely
to commit any offence while on bail
alone will entitle him to a bail under
section 37 (1) of NDPS Act. The other
aspect to be borne in mind is that the
liberty of a citizen has got to be
balanced with the interest of the
society. In cases where narcotic drugs
and psychotropic substances
are
involved, the accused would indulge in

activities which are lethal to the society.
Therefore, it would certainly be in the
interest of the society to keep such
persons behind bars during the
pendency of the proceedings before the
Court, and the validity of Section
37(1)(b) having been upheld, we cannot
take any other view.

Honorable Supreme Court Has held
whenever an objection is raised during
evidence taking stage regarding the
admissibility of any material or item of
oral evidence the trial Court can make a
note of such objection and mark the
objected document tentatively as an
exhibit in the case (or record the
objected part of the oral evidence)
subject to such objections to be decided
"at the last stage in the final judgment.
If the Court finds at the final stage that
the objection so raised is sustainable
the Judge or Magistrate can keep such
evidence excluded from consideration.
In our view there is no illegality in
adopting such a course. (However, we
make it-clear that if the objection
relates to deficiency of stamp duty of a
document the Court has to decide the
objection before proceeding further.
For all other objections the procedure
suggested above can be followed).

SCC 673,
The apex court after considering
section 37 of the NDPS act, has
considered the purpose for which the
NDPS Act was enacted and observed
as under in para 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the
said judgment: "The purpose for which
the Act was enacted and the menace of
drug trafficking which it intends to
curtail is evident from its scheme. A
perusal of section 37 of the Act leaves
no doubt in the mind of the court that a
person
accused
of an offence,
punishable for a term of imprisonment
of five years or more, shall generally be
not released on bail. Negation of bail is
the rule and its grant an exception
under sub clause (ii) of clause (b) of
section 37(1). For granting the bail the
court must, on the basis of the record
produced before it, be satisfied that
there are reasonable grounds for
believing that the accused is not guilty
of the offences with which he is
charged and further that he is not
likely to commit any offence while on
bail. It has further to be noticed that
the conditions for granting the bail,
specified in clause (b) of sub section (1)
of section 37 are in addition to the

Vs. Union

AIR 2002
SC 1450
Honorable Supreme Court held that no
interference warranted with conviction
and sentence against appellant. "Law
on the point is very clear that even if
there is any sort of procedural illegality
in conducting the search and seizure,
the evidence collected thereby will not
become inadmissible and the Court
would consider all the circumstances
and find out whether any serious
prejudice had been caused to the
accused. If the search and seizure was
in complete defiance of the law and
procedure and there was any possibility
of the evidence collected likely to have
been tempered with or interpolated
during the course of such search or
seizure, then, it could be said the
evidence is not liable to be admissible
in evidence. ...... though the mahazar
was not prepared at the spot where the
accused persons were found to be in
possession of the contraband article
but the same was done only at the
Office of the Customs Department
while the accused persons were very
much present throughout, there was no
allegation or suggestion that the
contraband article was, in any way,
meddled with by the officers.
Therefore, we are of the view that the
appellant has rightly been found to be
in possession of the opium. We find no
reason to interfere with the conviction
and sentence entered against the
appellant."

Pradesh
AIR2003
SC 3642
Honorable Supreme Court held that
the expression 'possession' is
a
polymorphous term which assumes
different colours in different contexts.
It may carry different meanings in
contextually different backgrounds. It is
impossible, as
was
observed in
Superintendent & Remembrancer of
Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil
Kumar
Bhunja
and
Ors.MANU/SC/0266/1979
:
1979
CriLJ1390 , to work out a completely
logical and precise definition of
"possession" uniformly applicable to all
situations in the context of all statutes.
The word 'conscious' means awareness
about a particular fact. It is a state of
mind which is deliberate orintended.
Once possession is established the
person who claims that it was not a
conscious possession has to establish it,
because how he came to be in
possession is within his special
knowledge. Section 35 of the Act gives
a statutory recognition of this position
because of presumption available in
law. Similar is the position in terms of
Section 54 where also presumption is
available to be drawn from possession
of illicit articles

Honorable Supreme Court decided the
question of law as to the Constitutional
validity of the proviso to Sub-section 1
of Section 41 of the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances (Amendment)
Act, 2001 (Act 9 of 2001). It was held
"In the result, we are of the view that
the proviso to Section 41 (1) of the
Amending
Act 9 of 2001 is
Constitutional and is not hit by Article
14. Consequently, in all cases, in which
the trials had concluded and appeals
were pending on 2.10.2001, when
Amending Act 9 of 2001 came into
force, the amendments introduced by
the Amending Act 9 of 2001 would not
be applicable and they would have to
be disposed off in accordance with the
NDPS Act, 1985 , as it stood before
2nd October, 2001. Since there are
other contentions of law and fact
raised in each of these cases, they
would have to be placed before the
appropriate Benches for decision and

Honourable Supreme Court held that
that there is not even a whisper about
the condition contained in Section 37 of
the N.D.P.S. Act with regard to
enlarging of the accused on bail. There
is no merit in contention that the
learned Public Prosecutor did not
oppose the bail as contained in Section
37(1)(b)(ii) of the N.D.P.S. Act. There is
no substance in argument that , unless
the Public Prosecutor opposes the bail
application, Section 37 will not apply. It
was contended that inasmuch as the
Appellants have not put on record that
the Public Prosecutor had opposed the
granting of bail, it must be presumed
that this is an order covered under
Section 37(3) read with Section 439,
Code of Criminal Procedure To say the
least, the argument appears to be
baseless. We cannot
accept the
contention that in a matter involving
seizure of commercial quantity of a
substance prohibited by the N.D.P.S.
Act when the Public Prosecutor
appears on notice of the bail
application he would be standing there
as a mute spectator not opposing the
bail application unless he was at the
back of the accused. We find no
substance in this argument.

Honourable Delhi High Court held
another aspect which has to be borne in
mind is the consideration of Section 18
of the Juvenile Justice Act which shows
that no juvenile, notwithstanding
anything contained in the Code of
Criminal Procedure or in any other law
for the time being in force, shall be
charged with or tried for any offence
together with a person who is not a
juvenile. Section 18(2) makes it the
mandatory duty of the Juvenile Justice
Board to direct separate trials for the
juvenile and the other person. This
makes it more than clear that a juvenile
can be tried only in terms of the
Juvenile Justice Act and that is before
the Juvenile Justice Board. These
provisions contained in the Juvenile
Justice Act, form part of a beneficial

legislation
and
are clear and
mandatory. Moreover, in the view I
have taken with regard to the sweep of
the non obstante clauses in the two
enactments, there is no conflict
between the two special Acts. In view
of the wordings of the provisions
themselves as also the nature of the

would prevail.

Honourable Supreme Court held that :-
(1) It is true that ordinarily the
prosecution
should examine all
witnesses whose names have been
disclosed in the charge-sheet ; but, then
the same cannot be said to be a rule
having universal application. Each case
has to be considered on its own facts.
(2)It is now well-settled that what is
necessary for proving the prosecution
case is not the quantity but quality of
the evidence. The Court cannot
overlook the changes in the value
system in the society. When an offence
is committed in a village owing to land
dispute, the independent witnesses
may not come forward.
(3)Medical science has not achieved
such perfection so as to enable a
medical practitioner to categorically
state in regard to the exact time of
death. In a case of this nature, it was
difficult to pinpoint the exact time of
death. The autopsy surgeon told about
the approximate time lag between the
date of post-mortem examination and
the likely date of death. He did not
explain the basis for arriving at his
opinion.

798
Honourable Supreme Court held that
Court while considering the application
for bail with reference to Section 37 of
the Act is not called upon to record a
finding of not guilty. It is for the limited
purpose essentially confined to the
question of releasing the accused on
bail that the Court is called upon to see
if there are reasonable grounds for
believing that the accused is not guilty
and records its satisfaction about the
existence of such grounds. But the
Court has not to consider the matter as
if it is pronouncing a judgment of
acquittal and recording a finding of not
guilty. No person shall be granted bail
unless the two conditions are satisfied.
They are; the satisfaction of the Court
that there are reasonable grounds for
believing that the accused is not guilty
and that he is not likely to commit any
offence while on bail. Both the
conditions have to be satisfied. If either
of these two conditions is not satisfied,
the bar operates and the accused
cannot be released on bail

SCC 417
Honourable Supreme Court held
sections 35 and 54 of the Act, no doubt,
raise presumptions with regard to the
culpable mental state on the part of the
accused as also place the burden of
proof in this behalf on the accused; but
a bare perusal of the said provision
would clearly show that presumption
would operate in the trial of the
accused only in the event the
circumstances contained therein are
fully satisfied. An initial burden exists
upon the prosecution and only when it
stands satisfied, would the legal burden
shift. Even then, the standard of proof
required for the accused to prove his
innocence is not as high as that of the
prosecution. Whereas the standard of
proof required to prove the guilt of the
accused on the prosecution is "beyond
all reasonable doubt"
but it is
"preponderance of probability" on the
accused. If the prosecution fails to
prove the foundational facts so as to
attract the rigours of Section 35 of the
Act, the actus reus which is possession
of contraband by the accused cannot
be said to have been established.

E.
Michael
Rajcase
(2008) 5
SCC 161
Honourable Supreme Court held that
actual percentage Of contraband is
relevant to determine quantity of
contraband. The Para 13 of the
judgment is reproduced for reference,
"It appears from the Statement
of Objects and Reasons of the
Amending Act of 2001 that the
intention of the legislature was to
rationalize the sentence structure so as
to ensure that while drug traffickers
who traffic in significant quantities of
drugs are punished with deterrent
sentence, the addicts and those who
commit less serious offences are
sentenced to less severe punishment.
Under the rationalised sentence
structure, the punishment would vary
depending upon the quantity of
offending material. Thus, we find it
difficult to accept the argument
advanced on behalf of the respondent
that the rate of purity is irrelevant since
any preparation which is more than the
commercial quantity of 250 gms. and
contains 0.2% of heroin or more would
be punishable under Section 21(c) of
the NDPS Act, because the intention of
the legislature as it appears to us is to
levy punishment based on the content
of the offending drug in the mixture
50
NARCOTICS CONTROL BUREAU
http://narcoticsindia.nic.in

=== PAGE 78 ===

and not on the weight of the mixture as
such. This may be tested on the
following rationale. Supposing 4 gms.
of heroin is recovered from an accused,
it would amount to a small quantity,
but when the same 4 gms. is mixed
with 50 kgs. of the powered sugar, it
would be quantified as a commercial
quantity. In the mixture of a narcotic
drug or a psychotropic substance with
one or more neutral substance/s, the
quantity of the neutral substance/s is
not to be taken into consideration while
determining the small quantity or
commercial quantity of a narcotic drug
or psychotropic substance. It is only the
actual content by weight of the narcotic
drug which is relevant for the purposes
of determining whether it would
constitute
small
quantity
or
commercial quantity. The intention of
the legislature for introduction of the
amendment as it appear to us is to
punish the people who commit less
serious offences with less severe
punishment and those who commit
grave crimes, such as trafficking in
significant quantities, with more severe
punishment."
However, vide notification
dated
18.11.2009 the DOR clarified the issue.

Officer-in-charge of a Police Station

statement made under Section 161 of
the Code unless made under threat or
coercion - Thus, statement made
under Section 67 of the N.D.P.S. Act
can be used as a confession against the
person making it and excludes it from

that there are reasonable grounds for

on the judgment in Raj Kumar's case
(Supra). The latest judgment in point of
time is Noor Aga's case which has dealt
very elaborately with this matter. We
thus feel it would be proper for us to
follow the ratio of the judgment in

It is true that the search and seizure of
contraband article is a serious aspect in
the matter of investigation related to
offences under the NDPS Act. The
NDPS Act and the Rules framed
thereunder have laid down a detailed
procedure and guidelines as to the
manner in which search and seizure are
to be effected. If there is any violation
of these guidelines, the courts would
take a serious view and the benefit
would be extended to the accused.

SCC 603
The summary of the Judgment is
organized into a point wise analysis.
The Court has expressed deep concern
for prolonged confinement of accused
persons in jail in NDPS cases and non-
commencement of trial for a long time.
The Court has given some directions by
way of present order for the speedy
trial of the NDPS cases.
1. ADJOURNMENTS:
The Court has expressed displeasure at
the adjournments granted in the Courts
in general and has directed that, grant
adjournments at the request of a party
except where the circumstances are
beyond the control of the party. The
Court has made a reference to the S.22
of the P.C. Act wherein the evidence
70
NARCOTICS CONTROL BUREAU
http://narcoticsindia.nic.in

=== PAGE 98 ===

can be recorded in the absence of the
accused.
2 EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES:
In Para 11, the Hon'ble Court has
highlighted the importance of Sessions
Trial i.e conducting examination and
cross examination of a witness on
consecutive days and has directed the
concerned Courts to adopt the method
of sessions trial and assign block dates
for examination of witnesses.
3. WORKLOAD:
In Para 14, the Court has stated that
each state particularly states of Uttar
Pradesh, West Club and Jammu &
Kashmir will have a Special Court and
that the number of Special Courts will
be in proportion to volume of cases.
is
It
also
stated that until
establishment of NDPS Courts, NDPS
cases will be prioritized over all other
matters.
4. NARCOTIC LABS:
In Para 15, Apex Court has pointed out
that each state is directed to establish
state level and regional level forensic
labs. The number of such labs will be
dependent upon the backlog of cases in
the state.
5. RE-TESTING PROVISIONS:
The Apex Court has highlighted the fact
that NDPS Act does not permit
resampling/re-testing of samples, thus
the Court ordered that any requests as
to re-testing/re-sampling shall not be
entertained under the NDPS Act as a
matter of course. These may, however,
be permitted, in extremely exceptional
circumstances, for cogent reasons to be
recorded by the Presiding judge. An
application in such rare cases must be
made within a period of fifteen days
from the receipt of the test report No

71

=== PAGE 99 ===

applications
for
re-testing
/re-
sampling
shall
be
entertained
thereafter.
6. MONITORING:
The Apex Court has directed that nodal
officers be appointed in all the
departments dealing with the NDPS
Cases for monitoring of the progress of
investigation and trial. This nodal
officer must be equivalent to the rank
of Superintendent of Police, who shall
ensure that the trial is not delayed due
to account of non-supply of documents,
non-availability of the witnesses, or for
any other reason.
The Apex Court has also stated that
there must be one Pairvi Officer or any
other officer for each Court who shall
report that days proceeding to the
nodal officer assigned for each Court.
7. PUBLIC PROSECUTORS:
The Apex Court has stressed upon the
quality of the SPPs and directed that,
the District and Sessions Judge shall
make recommendations for such
appointments in consultation with the
Administrative
Judge/Portfolio
Judge/Inspecting Judge, in-charge of
looking after the administration of the
concerned SessionsDivision."
8. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS:
The Apex Court has observed that for
simplification of the above detailed
process, the filing of the charge-sheet
and supply of the documents must also
be provided in electronic form.
However, the Court also directed that
this must not be treated as a substitute
for
hard
copies
which
are
indispensable for Court proceedings.

Honourable Supreme Court held that
section 42 of the N.D.P.S. Act, 1985
can be divided into two different parts.
First is the power of entry, search
seizure and arrest without warrant or
authorization as contemplated under
sub-section (1) of the said section.
Second is reporting of the information
reduced to writing to a higher officer in
consonance with sub-section (2) of that
section, Sub-section (2) of Section 42
had been a matter of judicial
interpretation as well as of legislative
concern in the past Sub-section (2) was
amended by the Parliament vide Act 9
of 2001 with effect from 2nd October.
2001. After amendment of this sub-
section, the words 'forthwith' stood
amended by the words 'within 72
hours'. In other words, whatever
ambiguity or leverage was provided for
under the unamended provision was
clarified and resultantly, absolute
certainty was brought in by binding the
officer concerned to send the
intimation to the superior officers
within 72 hours from the time of
receipt of information. The amendment
is suggestive of the legislative intent
that information must reach the
superior officer not only expeditiously
or forthwith but definitely within the
time contemplated under the amended
sub-section (2) of Section 42. This,
provides a greater certainty to the time
in which the action should be taken as
well as renders the safeguards provided
to an accused more meaningful. In the

unamended provision was in force. The
law as it existed at the time of

law which will govern the rights and

SCALE 39
Honourable Supreme Court held that :-
A perusal of Section 42 contemplates
two situations. It contemplates entry
into and search of any building,
conveyance or enclosed place in anytime
between sunrise and sunset by an officer
authorized under the Act with a reason
to believe that any narcotic substance or
any other controlled substance is kept
or concealed in such premises and
secondly, if the search is made between
the sunset and sunrise, the requirement
of the proviso to Section 42 is to be
complied with under which the officer
authorized under the Act is to record the
grounds of his belief. But if the search is
made by an officer authorized under
Section 41(2) of the Act then the said
officer is said to be acting under Section
41(2) and therefore compliance under
Section 42 is not necessary at all. This
principle is reiterated in the case of M.
Prabhulal v. The Assistant Director,
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence,
(2003) 8 SCC 449 and in Mohd.
Hussain Farah v. Union of India &
Anr.,2001 1 SCC 329, wherein it is
observed that a gazetted officer is an
empowered officer and so when a search
is carried out in his presence and under
his supervision, the provision of Section
42 has no application.

reason apart from the construction of
the language of Section 23 which

employs the expression transhipment.
It can be seen from the language of the

11699/201
2
Honourable Supreme Court in the case
of Vinod Kumar v. State of Punjab,
2013 1 RCR (Cri) 428 considered the
question as to whether a wholesale
drug dealer, a retailer and their
employees possessing proper and valid
licence for dealing in drugs specified in
Schedule C and Schedule C1 as well as
drugs not specified in those Schedules
of the D&C Act and the 1945 Rules can
be held liable for an offence punishable
under the NDPS Act. After making a
reference to Section 80 NDPS Act, it
was held that a person can very well be
prosecuted both under the NDPS Act as
well
as
under the D&C Act
simultaneously for violation of the
provisions of the said Acts. It was held
that merely because a person is
prosecuted for violation of D&C Act
that would not operate as a bar to
prosecute him under the provisions of
the NDPS Act. Rather if the offences
made out under the D&C Act also
comes within the scope of the
provisions of the NDPS Act such
person
shall be prosecuted for
possession of the contrabands violating
the provisions of the NDPS Act. Both
the Acts, it was held are independent
and violation of one Act does not mean
no violation of the other. Therefore,
merely, because prosecution is
launched and trial is conducted under
the NDPS Act, which is considered a
harsher and an onerous provision, the
initiation of the proceedings cannot be
said to be improper or bad. In case it is
done for any extraneous reasons or
circumstances or with a mala fide

intention, the same would of course be
subject to judicial scrutiny and review.
In the circumstances, when there has
been a contravention of a certain
manufactured drug or a psychotropic
substance and which falls within the
purview of NDPS Act and the NDPS
Rules, the possession, sale and
transportation of which is prohibited,
or is being done without proper licence
or with no proper authorization, the
prosecution under the provisions of the
NDPS Act would not be prohibited and
it cannot be said to be in any manner
illegal.

Appeal
652/2012)
(2016) 3
SCC 379
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
present matter had taken cognizance of
the fact that a lot of seized contraband
is being kept with the Central and State
agencies and that the efforts taken
towards the destruction of such
contraband are not adequate. The
Court has observed that the contraband
is finding its way back into the society.
After careful scrutiny of the collected
data from different agencies and High
Courts in regard to seizure, storage,
disposal and destruction of the seized
contraband, the Court has delivered a
judgment on these aspects of NDPS
law. The Court has observed that S.52
A requires that no sooner the seizure
is done, the contraband is to be
forwarded to the officer in charge of a
police station or the officer empowered.
Such an officer is then duty bound to
approach the Magistrate for drawing
samples and getting them certified. The
Court passed directions that the
agencies will
store the seized

The Court states that in cases that
stood finally concluded at Trial, appeal,
revision and further appeals, if any
before 29.5.1989, the continued storage
of NDPS, controlled substances and
conveyances is of no consequence and
has thus directed that all the Drugs
Disposal Committees of the States and
the Central agencies shall take stock of
all such seized contrabands and take
steps for their disposal without any
further verification.

1989 and where Trial and

all concluded:
This is the category of seizures that
have
been
undertaken
after
introduction of S. 52 A. In this category
of the cases Court has opined that it
will be a futile exercise if the drugs are
tested as per Para 5.5. of SO 1/89. The
Court has thus directed that all the
Drugs Disposal Committees shall take
stock of all such seized contrabands in
which trial has concluded
àm Cases where proceedings are still
pending before Trial Court, Appellate
Courts or before the Supreme Court :
The Court has directed that in all such

were not available to witness the
recovery of the contraband due to
extreme cold. In the absence of any
animosity between the police party and
the accused and having regard to the
large quantity of contraband that was
recovered (18.85 Kgs.), we are of the
view that it is unlikely that the
contraband had been planted/foisted in
the vehicle of the accused persons.
Insofar as the condition of the
contraband parcel is concerned, the
materials on record indicate that the
said parcel was brought to the learned
trial Court on 15.9.2009 in a torn

Judges)
Honourable Supreme Court held, while
allowing the appeal:
(i) For proving the offence under the
NDPS Act, it is necessary for the
prosecution to establish that the
quantity of the contraband goods
allegedly seized from the possession of
the Accused and the best evidence
would be the court records as to the
production of the contraband before
the Magistrate and deposit of the same
before the Malkhana or the document
showing destruction of the contraband.
[12]
(ii) The High Court appears to have
gone by the
oral evidence of
prosecution
witnesses
that the
contraband allegedly seized from the
Accused was produced before the
Magistrate. When the trial court which
was in possession of the case records
recorded a finding that there was no
order of the Magistrate showing the
production of the contraband before
the court and acquitted the Accused on
that basis, the High Court ought not to
have interfered with the said order of
acquittal. [14]
(iii) The findings of the trial court could
not be said to be distorted conclusions
warranting interference. Based on the
oral evidence of prosecution witnesses,
the High Court ought not to have
interfered with the order of acquittal
and the conviction of the Appellant
under Section 18 of the NDPS Act could
not be sustained. [16]

notwithstanding the pendency of the
bail application; or subsequent filing
of the charge sheet or a report
seeking an extension of time by the
prosecution before the Court; or
filing of the charge sheet during the
interregnum when the challenge to
the rejection of the bail application is
pending before a higher Court. It,
however, mentioned that where the
accused fails to apply for default bail
and when the right accrues to him,
subsequently
a
charge
sheet,
additional complaint or a report
seeking an extension of time is
preferred before the Magistrate; the
right to
default
bail
would be
extinguished. The Magistrate would
be at liberty to take cognizance of
the case or grant further time for
completion of the investigation, as
the case may be, though the accused
may still be released on bail under
other provisions of the CrPC. It
ordered that notwithstanding the
order of default bail passed by the
Court, the actual release of the
accused from custody is contingent
on the directions passed by the
competent Court granting bail. If the
accused fails to furnish bail and/or
comply
with
the
terms and
conditions of the bail order within
the time stipulated by the Court, his
continued detention in custody is

leniency should be shown to an
accused who is found to be guilty
for the offence under the NDPS Act.
Those persons who are dealing in

causing death or in inflicting death
blow to a number of innocent young
victims who are vulnerable. Such
accused causes deleterious effects
and deadly impact on the society.
They are hazard to the society. Such
organized activities of clandestine
smuggling of narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances into this
country and illegal trafficking in
such drugs and substances have a
deadly impact on the society as a
whole. Therefore, while awarding the
sentence or punishment in case of
NDPS Act, the interest of the society
as a whole is required to be taken
into consideration. Therefore, even
while applying discretion under
Section 427 of Cr.PC, the discretion
shall not be in favour of the accused
who is found to be indulging in
illegal trafficking in the narcotic
drugs and psychotropic substances.
As observed hereinabove, even while
exercising discretion under Section
427 of Cr.PC to run subsequent
sentence
concurrently with
the
previous sentence, the discretion is
to be exercised judiciously and
depending upon the offence/offences
committed. Therefore, considering
the offences under the NDPS Act
which are very serious in nature and
against the society at large, no
discretion shall be exercised in
favour of such accused who is
indulging into the offence under the
NDPS Act.

Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
mere absence of contraband with the
accused does become a solitary
reason for granting bail. Even after
the bail was granted, the accused
avoided criminal trials and it became
difficult for framing relevant issues.
Hence, the Court held that the High
Court did not give due weight to the
magnitude of the offence and its
impact and set aside the High Court
order. Absence Of Possession Of The

was not in person. Learned counsel
seeks to expand the scope of the
observations made by seeking to
contend that if the personal search
is vitiated by violation of Section 50
of the NDPS Act, the recovery made
otherwise also would stand vitiated
and thus, cannot be relied upon. We

No.870 Of

Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the
personal search did not result in
recovery of any contraband material
but
the
non- compliance of
requirement of affording an option
to be searched before a Magistrate
of a competent Gazetted Officer -
Accused acquitted. Reasons which
had weighed with the Trial Court in
acquitting the accused must be dealt
with, in case the appellate Court is
of the view that the acquittal
rendered by the Trial Court deserves
to be upturned - With an order of
acquittal by the Trial Court, the
normal presumption of innocence in
a criminal matter gets reinforced - If
two views are possible from the
evidence on record, the appellate
Court must be extremely slow in
interfering with the appeal against
acquittal.

Criminal
Appeal Nos.
1001-1002 of
2022
Hon'ble Supreme Court in this case summed up
that the expression "reasonable grounds" used in
clause (b) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 37 would
mean credible, plausible grounds for the Court to
believe that the accused person is not guilty of
the alleged offence. For arriving at any such
conclusion, such facts and circumstances must
exist in a case that can persuade the Court to
believe that the accused person would not have
committed such an offence. At the stage of
examining an application for bail in the context
of the Section 37 of the Act, the Court is not
required to record a finding that the accused
person is not guilty. The entire exercise that the
Court is expected to undertake at this stage is for
the limited purpose of releasing him on bail.
Thus, the focus is on the availability of
reasonable grounds for believing that the accused
is not guilty of the offences that he has been
charged with and he is unlikely to commit an
offence under the Act while on bail.

In other words, section 27 of the NDPS act does not override section 167 (2) of the code. Hence the legal position set out by Balakrishnan, J. in Appachan v. Excise Circle Inspector, (1990) 2 ALT 610 (DB) is correct

Searches, seizures and arrests -- Narcotics offences -- Cr. P.C., Ss. 100 & 165 are applicable to offences under the NDPS Act, since the latter Act is not a complete code. B. Search or arrest -- Narcotics offences- -Police officer making a chance recovery of narcotics, in the normal course of investigation under the Cr. P.C .-- NDPS Act, S. 50 not attracted -- Police officer, if he is empowered under the NDPS Act, should inform an empowered officer, who should thereafter proceed in accordance with the provisions of the NDPS Act. C. Search or arrest -- Narcotics offences- -Non-compliance with provisions of Cr. P.C., Ss. 100 & 165 by an empowered or authorised officer, would amount to an "irregularity" but not vitiate the trial. D. Search -- Narcotics officer -- Empowered or authorised officer, acting on prior information -- Requirements of NDPS Act, S. 50 are mandatory -- Noncompliance would affect prosecution case and vitiate the trial. E. Arrest or seizure -- Narcotics offences -- Seizure or arrest made under NDPS Act, Ss. 41 to 44 -- Provisions of Ss. 52 & 57 of NDPS Act not mandatory, noncompliance does not invalidate trial or conviction, but will have bearing on appreciation of evidence.

 | 1999 | State of Punjab Vs.

The requirement is for safeguard and protection and it must be followed scrupulously. The accused has a right to be informed, though not in writing. Failure to do so would render search illegal and would vitiate the conviction if not the trial-ratio of Supreme Court judgment in the case of State of Punjab v. Balbir Singh [1997 (69) ECR 260 (SC)].

The Supreme Court after examining the matter at length held that The jurisdiction of the Court to grant bail is circumscribed by the provision of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. It can be granted in case where there are reasonable grounds for believing that accused is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. It is the mandate of the legislature which is required to be followed. The Court set-aside the order of the High Court granting bail to the respondent and directed him to surrender

Division Bench of this Court in State Of Rajasthan Vs. Mana Singh & Ors. (supra), took note of decision of Apex court in Dadu v. State of Maharashtra (AIR 2000 SC 3202) and so also of S.32A of NDPS Act and parole Rules, wherein it has observed that the parole does not amount suspension, remission or commutation of sentence; as such a convict cannot be deprived of benefit of parole under the garb of S.32A of NDPS Act. The Division Bench finally observed that in view of Rule 1(c) of Rules, 1958, persons convicted under NDPS Act can be considered only under Rules framed by Central Government; and further observed that the Union of India may frame Rules providing guidelines for releasing the convicts of NDPS Act on parole or transfer to the open air camps keeping in view the objects behind enactment of NDPS Act; and till such Rules are framed, as interim arrangements, this Court provided guidelines for concerned authority & the Courts ad infra.

 | 2000 | Dadu @ Tulsidas Vs. State of Maharashtr a | AIR 2000 SC 3203 | The Constitutional validity of Section 32-A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, was challenged. The section is alleged to be arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India which creates unreasonable distinction between the prisoners convicted under the Act and the prisoners convicted for the offences punishable under various other statutes. It was held that awarding sentence, upon conviction, is concededly a


--- TABLE 40 ---
 |  |  |  | judicial function to be discharged by the Courts of law established in the country. It is always a matter of judicial discretion, however, subject to any mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by the Law. The award of sentence by a criminal court wherever made subject to the right of appeal cannot be interfered or intermeddled with in a way which amounts to not only interference but actually taking away the power of judicial review. Awarding the sentence and consideration of its legality or adequacy in appeal is essentially a judicial function embracing within its ambit the power to suspend the sentence under peculiar circumstances of each case, pending the disposal of the appeal. Not providing atleast one right of appeal, would negate the due process of law in the matter of dispensation of criminal justice. There is no doubt that the right of appeal is the creature of a statute and hence conferred, a substantive right. Providing a right of appeal but totally disarming the Court from granting interim relief in the form of suspension of sentence would be unjust, unfair and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution particularly when no mechanism is provided for early disposal of the appeal. The pendency of criminal litigation and the experience in dealing with pending matters indicate no possibility of early hearing of the appeal and its disposal on merits atleast in many High Courts.

--- TABLE 43 ---
 | 2001 | Intelligence Officer, Narcotics C. Bureau vs. Sambhu Sonkar and Anr. | AIR2001SC 830 | Question came for consideration in this case before the Court was whether the restrictions imposed under Section 37 of the NDPS Act would be applicable in a case where offence is punishable under Section 20(b)(i) for possessing Ganja? The Supreme Court held that scheme of section 37 reveals that the exercise of the power to grant bail by the Special Judge is not only subject to the limitations contained under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C., but is also subject to the limitation placed by Section 37 which commences with nonobstante clause. The operative part of the said section is in negative in prescribing the enlargement of bail of any person accused of commission of an offence under the Act unless two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that prosecution must be given an opportunity to oppose the application and the second is that the Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence. If either of these two conditions is not satisfied, the ban for granting bail operates. As per the mandate of Section 37, no person accused of an offence punishable for a term of imprisonment of 5 years or more under the Act can be released on bail unless the conditions mentioned in subclauses (i) and (ii) of Clause (b) are satisfied.

AIR2001SC 1158 | AIR 2001 SC 1158, | Honorable Supreme Court Has held whenever an objection is raised during evidence taking stage regarding the admissibility of any material or item of oral evidence the trial Court can make a note of such objection and mark the objected document tentatively as an exhibit in the case (or record the objected part of the oral evidence) subject to such objections to be decided "at the last stage in the final judgment. If the Court finds at the final stage that the objection so raised is sustainable the Judge or Magistrate can keep such evidence excluded from consideration. In our view there is no illegality in adopting such a course. (However, we make it-clear that if the objection relates to deficiency of stamp duty of a document the Court has to decide the objection before proceeding further. For all other objections the procedure suggested above can be followed).

24 | 2001 | Union of India Vs. Ashok Kumar Jaiswal | (2007)15SC C569 | Supreme Court held that Under the mandatory conditions provided in Section 37 before granting bail the Court is to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of offence and that he is not likely to commit offences under the Act while on bail. This Court in various judgments while quashing the orders granting bail to accused of offence under the Act have cautioned the courts about the mandatory requirements of Section 37.

A perusal of section 37 of the Act leaves no doubt in the mind of the court that a person accused of an offence, punishable for a term of imprisonment of five years or more, shall generally be not released on bail. Negation of bail is the rule and its grant an exception under sub clause (ii) of clause (b) of section 37(1). For granting the bail the court must, on the basis of the record produced before it, be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offences with which he is charged and further that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. It has further to be noticed that the conditions for granting the bail, specified in clause (b) of sub section (1) of section 37 are in addition to the

 | 2002 | Khet Singh Vs. Union of India | AIR 2002 SC 1450 | Honorable Supreme Court held that no interference warranted with conviction and sentence against appellant. "Law on the point is very clear that even if there is any sort of procedural illegality in conducting the search and seizure, the evidence collected thereby will not become inadmissible and the Court would consider all the circumstances and find out whether any serious prejudice had been caused to the accused. If the search and seizure was in complete defiance of the law and procedure and there was any possibility of the evidence collected likely to have been tempered with or interpolated during the course of such search or seizure, then, it could be said the evidence is not liable to be admissible in evidence. ...... though the mahazar was not prepared at the spot where the accused persons were found to be in possession of the contraband article but the same was done only at the Office of the Customs Department while the accused persons were very much present throughout, there was no allegation or suggestion that the contraband article was, in any way, meddled with by the officers. Therefore, we are of the view that the appellant has rightly been found to be in possession of the opium. We find no reason to interfere with the conviction and sentence entered against the appellant."

 | 2003 | Madan Lal and Ors. Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh | AIR2003 SC 3642 | Honorable Supreme Court held that the expression 'possession' is a polymorphous term which assumes different colours in different contexts. It may carry different meanings in contextually different backgrounds. It is impossible, as was observed in Superintendent & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil Kumar Bhunja and Ors.MANU/SC/0266/1979 : 1979 CriLJ1390 , to work out a completely logical and precise definition of "possession" uniformly applicable to all situations in the context of all statutes. The word 'conscious' means awareness about a particular fact. It is a state of mind which is deliberate orintended. Once possession is established the person who claims that it was not a conscious possession has to establish it, because how he came to be in possession is within his special knowledge. Section 35 of the Act gives a statutory recognition of this position because of presumption available in law. Similar is the position in terms of Section 54 where also presumption is available to be drawn from possession of illicit articles

It was held "In the result, we are of the view that the proviso to Section 41 (1) of the Amending Act 9 of 2001 is Constitutional and is not hit by Article 14. Consequently, in all cases, in which the trials had concluded and appeals were pending on 2.10.2001, when Amending Act 9 of 2001 came into force, the amendments introduced by the Amending Act 9 of 2001 would not be applicable and they would have to be disposed off in accordance with the NDPS Act, 1985 , as it stood before 2nd October, 2001. Since there are other contentions of law and fact raised in each of these cases, they would have to be placed before the appropriate Benches for decision and disposal in accordance with the law."

Act with regard to enlarging of the accused on bail. There is no merit in contention that the learned Public Prosecutor did not oppose the bail as contained in Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the N.D.P.S. Act. There is no substance in argument that , unless the Public Prosecutor opposes the bail application, Section 37 will not apply. It was contended that inasmuch as the Appellants have not put on record that the Public Prosecutor had opposed the granting of bail, it must be presumed that this is an order covered under Section 37(3) read with Section 439, Code of Criminal Procedure To say the least, the argument appears to be baseless. We cannot accept the contention that in a matter involving seizure of commercial quantity of a substance prohibited by the N.D.P.S. Act when the Public Prosecutor appears on notice of the bail application he would be standing there as a mute spectator not opposing the bail application unless he was at the back of the accused. We find no substance in this argument.

Section 18(2) makes it the mandatory duty of the Juvenile Justice Board to direct separate trials for the juvenile and the other person. This makes it more than clear that a juvenile can be tried only in terms of the Juvenile Justice Act and that is before the Juvenile Justice Board. These provisions contained in the Juvenile Justice Act, form part of a beneficial

Moreover, in the view I have taken with regard to the sweep of the non obstante clauses in the two enactments, there is no conflict between the two special Acts. In view of the wordings of the provisions themselves as also the nature of the enactments, the Juvenile Justice Act would prevail.

Each case has to be considered on its own facts. (2)It is now well-settled that what is necessary for proving the prosecution case is not the quantity but quality of the evidence. The Court cannot overlook the changes in the value system in the society. When an offence is committed in a village owing to land dispute, the independent witnesses may not come forward. (3)Medical science has not achieved such perfection so as to enable a medical practitioner to categorically state in regard to the exact time of death. In a case of this nature, it was difficult to pinpoint the exact time of death. The autopsy surgeon told about the approximate time lag between the date of post-mortem examination and the likely date of death. He did not explain the basis for arriving at his opinion.

It is for the limited purpose essentially confined to the question of releasing the accused on bail that the Court is called upon to see if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty and records its satisfaction about the existence of such grounds. But the Court has not to consider the matter as if it is pronouncing a judgment of acquittal and recording a finding of not guilty. No person shall be granted bail unless the two conditions are satisfied. They are; the satisfaction of the Court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. Both the conditions have to be satisfied. If either of these two conditions is not satisfied, the bar operates and the accused cannot be released on bail

An initial burden exists upon the prosecution and only when it stands satisfied, would the legal burden shift. Even then, the standard of proof required for the accused to prove his innocence is not as high as that of the prosecution. Whereas the standard of proof required to prove the guilt of the accused on the prosecution is "beyond all reasonable doubt" but it is "preponderance of probability" on the accused. If the prosecution fails to prove the foundational facts so as to attract the rigours of Section 35 of the Act, the actus reus which is possession of contraband by the accused cannot be said to have been established.

Supposing 4 gms. of heroin is recovered from an accused, it would amount to a small quantity, but when the same 4 gms. is mixed with 50 kgs. of the powered sugar, it would be quantified as a commercial quantity. In the mixture of a narcotic drug or a psychotropic substance with one or more neutral substance/s, the quantity of the neutral substance/s is not to be taken into consideration while determining the small quantity or commercial quantity of a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance. It is only the actual content by weight of the narcotic drug which is relevant for the purposes of determining whether it would constitute small quantity or commercial quantity. The intention of the legislature for introduction of the amendment as it appear to us is to punish the people who commit less serious offences with less severe punishment and those who commit grave crimes, such as trafficking in significant quantities, with more severe punishment."

The NDPS Act and the Rules framed thereunder have laid down a detailed procedure and guidelines as to the manner in which search and seizure are to be effected. If there is any violation of these guidelines, the courts would take a serious view and the benefit would be extended to the accused.

The Court has given some directions by way of present order for the speedy trial of the NDPS cases. 1. ADJOURNMENTS: The Court has expressed displeasure at the adjournments granted in the Courts in general and has directed that, grant adjournments at the request of a party except where the circumstances are beyond the control of the party.

MONITORING: The Apex Court has directed that nodal officers be appointed in all the departments dealing with the NDPS Cases for monitoring of the progress of investigation and trial. This nodal officer must be equivalent to the rank of Superintendent of Police, who shall ensure that the trial is not delayed due to account of non-supply of documents, non-availability of the witnesses, or for any other reason. The Apex Court has also stated that there must be one Pairvi Officer or any other officer for each Court who shall report that days proceeding to the nodal officer assigned for each Court. 7.

OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS: The Apex Court has observed that for simplification of the above detailed process, the filing of the charge-sheet and supply of the documents must also be provided in electronic form. However, the Court also directed that this must not be treated as a substitute for hard copies which are indispensable for Court proceedings.

 | 2013 | Sukhdev Singh Vs. State of Haryana | AIR2013SC 953 | Honourable Supreme Court held that section 42 of the N.D.P.S. Act, 1985 can be divided into two different parts. First is the power of entry, search seizure and arrest without warrant or authorization as contemplated under sub-section (1) of the said section. Second is reporting of the information reduced to writing to a higher officer in consonance with sub-section (2) of that section, Sub-section (2) of Section 42 had been a matter of judicial interpretation as well as of legislative concern in the past Sub-section (2) was amended by the Parliament vide Act 9 of 2001 with effect from 2nd October. 2001. After amendment of this sub- section, the words 'forthwith' stood amended by the words 'within 72 hours'. In other words, whatever ambiguity or leverage was provided for under the unamended provision was clarified and resultantly, absolute certainty was brought in by binding the officer concerned to send the intimation to the superior officers within 72 hours from the time of receipt of information. The amendment is suggestive of the legislative intent that information must reach the superior officer not only expeditiously or forthwith but definitely within the time contemplated under the amended sub-section (2) of Section 42. This, provides a greater certainty to the time in which the action should be taken as well as renders the safeguards provided to an accused more meaningful. In the

 | 2014 | Yasihey Yobin and anr.Vs. The Departmen t of customs | 2014(1) SCALE 39 | Honourable Supreme Court held that :- A perusal of Section 42 contemplates two situations. It contemplates entry into and search of any building, conveyance or enclosed place in anytime between sunrise and sunset by an officer authorized under the Act with a reason to believe that any narcotic substance or any other controlled substance is kept or concealed in such premises and secondly, if the search is made between the sunset and sunrise, the requirement of the proviso to Section 42 is to be complied with under which the officer authorized under the Act is to record the grounds of his belief. But if the search is made by an officer authorized under Section 41(2) of the Act then the said officer is said to be acting under Section 41(2) and therefore compliance under Section 42 is not necessary at all. This principle is reiterated in the case of M. Prabhulal v. The Assistant Director, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence,

State of Punjab, 2013 1 RCR (Cri) 428 considered the question as to whether a wholesale drug dealer, a retailer and their employees possessing proper and valid licence for dealing in drugs specified in Schedule C and Schedule C1 as well as drugs not specified in those Schedules of the D&C Act and the 1945 Rules can be held liable for an offence punishable under the NDPS Act. After making a reference to Section 80 NDPS Act, it was held that a person can very well be prosecuted both under the NDPS Act as well as under the D&C Act simultaneously for violation of the provisions of the said Acts. It was held that merely because a person is prosecuted for violation of D&C Act that would not operate as a bar to prosecute him under the provisions of the NDPS Act. Rather if the offences made out under the D&C Act also comes within the scope of the provisions of the NDPS Act such person shall be prosecuted for possession of the contrabands violating the provisions of the NDPS Act. Both the Acts, it was held are independent and violation of one Act does not mean no violation of the other. Therefore, merely, because prosecution is launched and trial is conducted under the NDPS Act, which is considered a harsher and an onerous provision, the initiation of the proceedings cannot be said to be improper or bad. In case it is done for any extraneous reasons or circumstances or with a mala fide

In the circumstances, when there has been a contravention of a certain manufactured drug or a psychotropic substance and which falls within the purview of NDPS Act and the NDPS Rules, the possession, sale and transportation of which is prohibited, or is being done without proper licence or with no proper authorization, the prosecution under the provisions of the NDPS Act would not be prohibited and it cannot be said to be in any manner illegal.

The Court has observed that the contraband is finding its way back into the society. After careful scrutiny of the collected data from different agencies and High Courts in regard to seizure, storage, disposal and destruction of the seized contraband, the Court has delivered a judgment on these aspects of NDPS law. The Court has observed that S.52 A requires that no sooner the seizure is done, the contraband is to be forwarded to the officer in charge of a police station or the officer empowered. Such an officer is then duty bound to approach the Magistrate for drawing samples and getting them certified. The Court passed directions that the agencies will store the seized contraband as per the directions issued in NCB Standing order 1/89. The Court also ordered that the storage facilities will be upgraded at the State and Central level and will be placed under the overall supervision of a gazetted officer and put under double lock system and etc. The Court has also observed that periodical inspection of the storage facilities is also missing.

In this category of the cases Court has opined that it will be a futile exercise if the drugs are tested as per Para 5.5. of SO 1/89.

On default of payment of the fine amount, it was ordered by the learned trial Court that the accused- Respondents will suffer imprisonment for a further period of one year. examination of independent witnesses is not an indispensable requirement and such non-examination is not necessarily fatal to the prosecution case. In the present case, according to the prosecution, independent witnesses

 |  |  |  | were not available to witness the recovery of the contraband due to extreme cold. In the absence of any animosity between the police party and the accused and having regard to the large quantity of contraband that was recovered (18.85 Kgs.), we are of the view that it is unlikely that the contraband had been planted/foisted in the vehicle of the accused persons. Insofar as the condition of the contraband parcel is concerned, the materials on record indicate that the said parcel was brought to the learned trial Court on 15.9.2009 in a torn condition.

[12] (ii) The High Court appears to have gone by the oral evidence of prosecution witnesses that the contraband allegedly seized from the Accused was produced before the Magistrate. When the trial court which was in possession of the case records recorded a finding that there was no order of the Magistrate showing the production of the contraband before the court and acquitted the Accused on that basis, the High Court ought not to have interfered with the said order of acquittal. [14] (iii) The findings of the trial court could not be said to be distorted conclusions warranting interference. Based on the oral evidence of prosecution witnesses, the High Court ought not to have interfered with the order of acquittal and the conviction of the Appellant under Section 18 of the NDPS Act could not be sustained.

 | 2019 | Yusuji Hinagata v. State, | 2019(4)Bo mCR(Cri)8 46 | Discussing the scope of Section 50 of NDPS Act, the High Court relied on Arif Khan v. State of Uttarakhand, (2018) 18 SCC 380, and noted that it is obligatory upon the officer concerned to apprise the suspect of his right to be searched before a Gazetted Officer or Magistrate. The Court was of the opinion that the mandatory requirement of Section 50 was not satisfied in the present case, and therefore the impugned order was liable to be set aside.

The officer concerned shall then approach the Magistrate with an application under Section 52-A(2) of the Act, which shall be allowed by the Magistrate as soon as may be required under sub-section (3) of Section 52-A, as discussed by us in the body of this judgment under the heading "seizure and sampling".

 |  |  |  | the presence of judicial magistrate. The proceedings before the judicial magistrate in relation to inventory, the photographs of narcotics drugs and psychotropic substances and any list of samples drawn under section 52A (2) and certified by the magistrate as being the primary evidence in respect of such offence.

 | 2020 | State of Kerala etc. Vs. Rajesh Etc | CRIMINAL APPEAL NO(S). 154- 157 OF 2020 | Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the expression "reasonable grounds" means something more than prima facie grounds. It contemplates substantial probable causes for believing that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence. The reasonable


--- TABLE 119 ---
 |  |  |  | belief contemplated in the provision requires existence of such facts and circumstances as are sufficient in themselves to justify satisfaction that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence. In the case on hand, the High Court seems to have completely overlooked the underlying object of Section 37 that in addition to the limitations provided under the CrPC, or any other law for the time being in force, regulating the grant of bail, its liberal approach in the matter of bail under the NDPS Act is indeed uncalled for.

Solely on the basis of some apprehension or the doubts, the entire prosecution version cannot be discarded and the accused is not to be straightway acquitted unless and until the accused is able to establish and prove the bias and the prejudice.

 | 2020 | Rizwan Khan Vs. State of Chhattisgar h | AIR 2020 SC 4297 | Honourable Supreme Court held that :- (I) There was no law that the evidence of police officials, unless supported by independent evidence, was to be discarded and/or unworthy of acceptance. (II) To prove the case under the NDPS Act, the ownership of the vehicle is not required to be established and proved. It was enough to establish and prove that the contraband articles were found from the Accused from the vehicle purchased by the Accused. Ownership of the vehicle was immaterial. What was required to be established and proved was the recovery of the contraband articles and the commission of an offence under the NDPS Act. Therefore, merely because of the ownership of the vehicle was not established and proved and/or the vehicle was not recovered subsequently, trial was not vitiated, while the prosecution had been

116 | 2020 | Gurmail Chand v. State of Punjab | AIR 2020 SC 2161 | Honourable Supreme Court held that It is true that the communication to the immediate superior has not been made in the form of a report, but we find, which is also recorded by the High Court, that PW5 has sent copies of FIR and other documents to his superior officer, which is not in dispute. Ext. P-9 shows that the copies of the FIR along with other records regarding the arrest of the Appellant and seizure of the contraband articles were sent by PW5 to his superior officer immediately after registering the said case. So, all the necessary information to be submitted in a report was sent. This constitutes substantial compliance and mere absence of any such report cannot be said to have prejudiced the Accused.

We are also conscious that this Court has passed orders for release of persons on bail to de-congest the jail but that is applicable to cases of upto seven years sentence.

 | 2020 | M Ravindran VS The Intelligence Officer | S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 2333 of 2020 | The Supreme Court in this case, struck down the judgement passed by the HC on the grounds that the right to be released on default bail continues to remain enforceable if the accused has applied for such bail,


--- TABLE 127 ---
 |  |  |  | notwithstanding the pendency of the bail application; or subsequent filing of the charge sheet or a report seeking an extension of time by the prosecution before the Court; or filing of the charge sheet during the interregnum when the challenge to the rejection of the bail application is pending before a higher Court. It, however, mentioned that where the accused fails to apply for default bail and when the right accrues to him, subsequently a charge sheet, additional complaint or a report seeking an extension of time is preferred before the Magistrate; the right to default bail would be extinguished. The Magistrate would be at liberty to take cognizance of the case or grant further time for completion of the investigation, as the case may be, though the accused may still be released on bail under other provisions of the CrPC. It ordered that notwithstanding the order of default bail passed by the Court, the actual release of the accused from custody is contingent on the directions passed by the competent Court granting bail. If the accused fails to furnish bail and/or comply with the terms and conditions of the bail order within the time stipulated by the Court, his continued detention in custody is valid.

 | 2021 | Mohd. Zahid vs. State through NCB | Criminal Appeal No. 147 of 2021 | Hon'ble Supreme Court held that no leniency should be shown to an accused who is found to be guilty for the offence under the NDPS Act. Those persons who are dealing in narcotic drugs are instruments in


--- TABLE 129 ---
 |  |  |  | causing death or in inflicting death blow to a number of innocent young victims who are vulnerable. Such accused causes deleterious effects and deadly impact on the society. They are hazard to the society. Such organized activities of clandestine smuggling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances into this country and illegal trafficking in such drugs and substances have a deadly impact on the society as a whole. Therefore, while awarding the sentence or punishment in case of NDPS Act, the interest of the society as a whole is required to be taken into consideration. Therefore, even while applying discretion under Section 427 of Cr.PC, the discretion shall not be in favour of the accused who is found to be indulging in illegal trafficking in the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. As observed hereinabove, even while exercising discretion under Section 427 of Cr.PC to run subsequent sentence concurrently with the previous sentence, the discretion is to be exercised judiciously and depending upon the offence/offences committed. Therefore, considering the offences under the NDPS Act which are very serious in nature and against the society at large, no discretion shall be exercised in favour of such accused who is indulging into the offence under the NDPS Act.

No. 5191 of 2021 | In this judgment, Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down guidelines for grant of bail by lower courts. The guidelines are issued to fill the lacuna in the intervening period between the completion of investigation and the initiation of trial, that is, the stage when investigation has concluded and chargesheet/complaint has been filed, but the accused was not arrested during the investigation. Hon'ble Supreme Court has categorized the offences for grant of bail.

Even after the bail was granted, the accused avoided criminal trials and it became difficult for framing relevant issues. Hence, the Court held that the High Court did not give due weight to the magnitude of the offence and its impact and set aside the High Court order.

The recovery was not in person. Learned counsel seeks to expand the scope of the observations made by seeking to contend that if the personal search is vitiated by violation of Section 50 of the NDPS Act, the recovery made otherwise also would stand vitiated and thus, cannot be relied upon. We cannot give such an extended view as is sought to be contended by learned counsel for the appellant."

Reasons which had weighed with the Trial Court in acquitting the accused must be dealt with, in case the appellate Court is of the view that the acquittal rendered by the Trial Court deserves to be upturned - With an order of acquittal by the Trial Court, the normal presumption of innocence in a criminal matter gets reinforced - If two views are possible from the evidence on record, the appellate Court must be extremely slow in interfering with the appeal against acquittal.

 | 2022 | Narcotics Control Bureau v. Mohit Aggarwal | Criminal Appeal Nos. 1001-1002 of 2022 | Hon'ble Supreme Court in this case summed up that the expression "reasonable grounds" used in clause (b) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 37 would mean credible, plausible grounds for the Court to believe that the accused person is not guilty of the alleged offence. For arriving at any such conclusion, such facts and circumstances must exist in a case that can persuade the Court to believe that the accused person would not have committed such an offence. At the stage of examining an application for bail in the context of the Section 37 of the Act, the Court is not required to record a finding that the accused person is not guilty. The entire exercise that the Court is expected to undertake at this stage is for the limited purpose of releasing him on bail. Thus, the focus is on the availability of reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offences that he has been charged with and he is unlikely to commit an offence under the Act while on bail.

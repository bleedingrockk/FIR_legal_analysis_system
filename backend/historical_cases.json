The report was kept on hold to allow further investigation into other alleged irregularities in MUDA allotments.\nThe Court today accepted the closure report and directed its registry to return the CD files and the draft final report, which had been kept in sealed cover, to the investigating officer after proper verification.\nThe complainant was present in person, while the Special Public Prosecutor representing the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Karnataka Lokayukta also appeared before the court.\nThe case will be heard next on February 9 when the final report for the remaining accused would be filed.\nFollow Bar and Bench channel on WhatsApp\nDownload the Bar and Bench Mobile app for instant access to the latest legal news.\nSpecial MP/MLA court\nSiddaramaiah\nChief Minister Siddaramaiah\nMUDA Scam\nNews\nDelhi High Court moots committee to address encroachment, illegal hawkers, rickshaws at Chandni Chowk\nThe Court said that all civic agencies will report to the committee, which will be tasked with the day-to-day monitoring of the situation. \nImage 5:  Chandni Chowk\nChandni Chowk\nBhavini Srivastava\n\nPublished on:\n28 Jan 2026, 1:49 pm\n2 min read\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   Copied \nFollow Us\n\nThe Delhi High Court on Wednesday said that it will constitute a committee to look into the encroachment, traffic violations, illegal hawking and other impermissible activities in the Chandni Chowk area _[Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal vs. Delhi Police through Commissioner of Police & Ors.]._\nThe Division Bench of Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia stated that all the civic agencies will report to the committee, which will be tasked with the day-to-day monitoring of the situation.\n_“What we propose to do is, we will form a committee. All departments and corporations shall report to the committee. We will call for a report from the committee. Everything that is envisaged by an agency will have to be taken to the committee first. After the nod is given by the committee then that plan will be executed. These things become difficult for the court to monitor. Everyday monitoring by the court will not be possible. There has to be a broader plan. There has to be day-to-day action. We would involve these associations,”_ the Court stated.\nImage 6: Justice Vinod Chandran and Justice PV Sanjay Kumar\nChief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia\nThe Court made the proposition while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by the traders' body of the Chandi Chowk.\nSenior Advocate Sanjeev Ralli,appearing on behalf of the petitioner, apprised the Court of the issues plaguing the Chandani Chowk area.\nHe raised concerns regarding rickshaw plying, loading and unloading of goods during restricted hours, illegal parking, illegal encroachment by hawkers and squatters, sanitation, heritage conservation, infrastructure damage and non-functioning traffic lights.\n_“Only 400 rickshaws are permitted, there are 2,000 rickshaws in the area. This area is no vending, hawking, squatting zone. Unauthorised hawking is taking place,”_ he stated.\nHe submitted a list of suggestions and recommendations that was considered by the Court.\nTo the submissions, the Chief Justice remarked,\n_“What measure can be taken to stop all this? Every single person entering this area should be accompanied by a police man? We also need to be sensitive.”_\nThe Chief Justice stated that it is conscious of the human problem.\n_“People’s livelihood is involved. There are small vendors, hawkers. This becomes a human problem as well. Enforcing rule is very easy,”_ the Court stated.\nThe Court was also told that langars are organised at Gurudwaras and that there are several temples and churches that raise footfall in the area.\n_“How to tackle, that is for you. The entire area will get ruined, then you will regret. Every single resident of Delhi, and with any kind of association with Delhi will regret. Your officers need to be sensitive,”_ the Court stated.\nThe Court then asked the parties to suggest names of senior officials, local persons for the purpose of forming the committee.\n_“We will include the members of Vyapar Mandal is some capacity. Kindly give names of some persons of the Vyapar Mandal who are respected across the area,”_ the Court stated.\nThe Court posted the matter for further consideration on February 24.\n[Read live coverage]\nFollow Bar and Bench channel on WhatsApp\nDownload the Bar and Bench Mobile app for instant access to the latest legal news.\nDelhi High Court\nhawking\nChandni Chowk Encroachment\nChief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya\nJustice Tejas Karia\nLitigation News\nWaqf Act 1995 does not oust civil courts' jurisdiction and confer omnibus jurisdiction on Waqf Tribunal: Supreme Court\nWaqf Tribunals have jurisdiction only with respect to the properties specified in the ‘list of Auqaf’, the Court ruled.\nImage 7: Supreme Court of India\nSupreme Court of India\nImage 8: Justice Vinod Chandran and Justice PV Sanjay Kumar\nDebayan Roy\n\nPublished on:\n28 Jan 2026, 1:10 pm\n3 min read\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   Copied \nFollow Us\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday held that the civil courts are not automatically divested of jurisdiction under Section 85 (bar of jurisdiction of civil courts) of the Waqf Act, 1995 _[Habib Alladin vs Mohammad Ahmed]_\nA Bench of Justices K Vinod Chandran and Sanjay Kumar opined that the jurisdiction of Waqf Tribunals under the Waqf Act, 1995 is confined to matters specifically conferred by the statute.\n\"_There is hence no absolute and all-pervasive ouster of jurisdiction of the Civil Court even under Section 85 of the Act of 1995_,\" the Court said.\nImage 9: Justice Vinod Chandran and Justice PV Sanjay Kumar\nJustice Vinod Chandran and Justice PV Sanjay Kumar\nThe Court added that the Section 83 of the Act is essentially an enabling provision for the constitution of tribunals and cannot be read as granting a general or omnibus power to decide all disputes relating to waqf.\n“_Section 83 does not confer any jurisdiction on the Tribunal, either/or an omnibus consideration of any dispute, question or other matter related to waqf or of waqf property, nor with respect to eviction of a tenant or determination of the rights and obligations of lessor and lessee of waqf property. It merely enables the constitution of the Tribunal,_” the Court held.\nOn the point of whether a property is waqf or not, the Court ruled that such question falls within the tribunal’s jurisdiction only when the property is specified in the ‘list of auqaf’ as contemplated under the Act.\nIt explained that the applicability of the Act to all auqaf does not by itself determine jurisdiction.\n\"_The definition of ‘waqf’ under Section 85, 3(r) and the applicability of the Act of 1995 on all auqaf (Section 2) does not also determine jurisdiction which, in resolution to disputes with respect to a property being a waqf or not is expressly conferred on the Tribunal, only with respect to those properties specified in the ‘list of Auqaf’_,\" the Bench said.\nThe Court further said that the power to remove encroachers is specifically conferred under Section 54(3) and (4) of the Act, exercisable at the instance of the Chief Executive Officer of the Waqf Board and not under Section 83.\nThe Bench also opined that the 2013 amendment to the Act altered that position only to a limited extent.\n“_The amendment Act of 2013 removes the sub-stratum of the decision in Ramesh Gobindram only to the extent of the absence found of the jurisdiction conferred on the Tribunal to remove encroachers and does not, in any other manner, interfere with the principle stated of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Act of 1995_,” the Court said.\nThe Court was dealing with an appeal that arose from a suit seeking a permanent injunction to restrain interference with prayers in a space claimed to be a mosque, located on the ground floor of a residential apartment complex.\nThe defendants moved an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the suit, contending that the premises was neither notified in the list of auqaf nor registered under the Act and, thus, the Waqf Tribunal lacked jurisdiction.\nThe Tribunal, however, rejected the application. The High Court also declined to interfere, holding that the plaint disclosed a case of “waqf by user”.\nIn the judgment delivered today, the top court held that since the property was neither specified in the list of auqaf under Chapter II nor registered under Chapter V, the tribunal had no jurisdiction to decide whether it was waqf property.\n“_The injunction simpliciter sought for before the Tribunal does not fall within its jurisdiction and the plaint has to be rejected_,” the Court held, setting aside the orders of the Tribunal and the High Court.\nIt, thus, also rejected the suit filed before the tribunal, leaving the question of whether the property in question is a _waqf_ open to be agitated in accordance with law.\n[Read Judgment]\nAttachment\nPDF\nHabib Alladin vs Mohammed Ahmed\nPreview\nFollow Bar and Bench channel on WhatsApp\nDownload the Bar and Bench Mobile app for instant access to the latest legal news.\nSupreme Court of India\nWaqf Act 1995\nWaqf Property\nWaqf Tribunal\nImage 10: barandbench\nFollow Us\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\nSubscribe\n   News⌄\n   Corporate & In-House News\n   Litigation\n   Law & Policy\n   Law Schools\n   Judges\n   Interviews⌄\n   Corporate & In-House\n   Litigation\n   Law Schools\n   Law & Policy\n   Columns⌄\n   Corporate & In-House\n   Law & Policy\n   Litigation\n   The Recruiters\n   Working Title\n   Viewpoint\n   Dealstreet\n   Student Subscription\n   Latest Legal News\n   Supreme Court of India\n   Terms Of Use\n   Privacy Policy\n   Contact Us\n   Careers\n   Advertise with us\n   About us\nCopyright © 2021 Bar and Bench.
